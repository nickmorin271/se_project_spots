**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**CSS**

In this CSS, we will see more advanced uses such as Media Quaries to fit all screen sizes, blocks to organize our coding and styles, handling text overflows to make sure not even the titles or descriptions will overlap.

**HTML**

the markup for the file structure is built similarly to other projects like using lists for the different cards and content.

**Responsive Design**

Part of the HTML markup are the use of buttons and changing how they interact with the cursor whether its a hover or a click. In this instance the button changes when you hover over it and i added a sutble change to the curser to change to a pointing finger when hovering.

**Media Quiaries**

This CSS style was introduced in this sprint and to make sure the page fits on all types of screens big or small. Using @Media was able to make sure everything is in place.
